# ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge Scoring system

This system contains the scripts and tools that can be used to 
recreate the results of the ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge and to
evaluate new datasets.

The release used to produce results for the [website](http://www.tractometer.org/ismrm_2015_challenge/) and
paper is archived on Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/55703078.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/55703078).


Configuration and installation
------------------------------

Make sure the "pip" version is recent enough. You can update it with

```bash
pip install -U pip
```

Then, install the needed dependencies using the requirements file.
The team recommends using a [virtual environment](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
(with the [virtual env wrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), but
it is not mandatory. Once setup, run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then clone or download the scoring system. Once cloned or
downloaded, go inside the ```ismrm_2015_tractography_challenge_scoring```
directory, and run

```bash
python setup.py
```

Once those steps are all done, the system is configured.

Fetching the Ground Truth Dataset
---------------------------------

To be able to run the scoring system, a directory containing the ground
truth dataset is needed. It can be downloaded from
[the Tractometer website](http://www.tractometer.org/downloads/downloads/scoring_data_tractography_challenge.tar.gz).


Scoring a tractogram
--------------------

Before trying to run the script, the terminal needs to be configured
to correctly find the code. Suppose the code is cloned in a directory
```CODE_DIR/ismrm_2015_tractography_challenge_scoring```, run the following
command

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=CODE_DIR/ismrm_2015_tractography_challenge_scoring
```

Once the ground truth dataset is unarchived (for example, to the
```scoring_data``` directory, one needs to create a directory where
all results will be saved. Let's call it ```results``` for now.

Then, an example call to the scoring system will be

```bash
./scripts/score_tractogram.py YOUR_TRACTOGRAM_FILE scoring_data/ results/
```

where ```YOUR_TRACTOGRAM_FILE``` is replaced with the path of the
tractogram file that will be scored.

Additional flags use to control the saving behavior of the script are
available. Call ```score_tractogram.py -h``` to get the list of such
flags.
